# SneakrHeads - Sneakers and Sport Shoes E-commerce Store

"SneakrHeads" is a sports-fashion e-commerce website that allows shoppers to browse, search for and purchase the most popular sneakers and trainers. 

The project aims to build a website on the Django Framework for improved security and speedy development. It allows user's to register an account and log in to review their orders. Additionally, the website will record the the customer's cart so as to allow them to view their next potential purchases. Furthermore, the site will also utilise the stripe API in order to assist customer's with finalising their purchase and securely save their payment information for future orders.

## User Experience Design

### **The Strategy Plane**

The main target audience of the website are online shoppers particularly those who are into sports brands, trainers and sneakers. 
The site will implement a header image of a popular sports brand's trainers and this will communicate what the site is about, an e-commerce store for sneakers. The website allows like minded sneaker fans to search, purchase and create an account. 

The store will utilise and effective navigation and search functionality so as to assist potential buyers with viewing and browsing. This strategy will also allow established users to easily view products they may want to purchase. The site will also utilise a shopping basket functionality. Where the user will be notified every time they add an item to their basket. This basket will also be easily accessible so as to allow the user to find out what they have placed in their basket and encourage them to checkout. 

#### Site Goals

EDIT! - Speak about superuser, sql, csrf tokens

Database security is maintained through the "env.py" file which ensures that the configuration files are not stored in github via .gitignore. For production, the configuration details are placed into the app settings within...

### Future Implementations & Room for Improvement

- The Categories/Products grid was initially utilised to assist customers/users with accessing certain products through an image grid. For this purpose of this project, the grid was focused primarily on front-end and did not contain any backend. Hence, it has been removed for assessment and will be refined and re-added.

- In future I would like to allow customers to contact the store owners through a contact form. 

- I would like to add more content such as products and images in the AWS S3 bucket for the use of this project.

- The basket page does not look appealing on mobiles phones or on small devices. In future, I would like to refactor the code on this page so as to improve the look and style of the mobile display for the page.

- In future I would like to fine tune this project even further and ensure that it passes Pep8/Flake 8, W3C HTML, CSS and JS Hint validators. At the moment the project still has many errors regarding best practices and validation.

- Refine the sizing logic and parameters for certain products such as socks or shoes e.g size UK 9.5. 

- Have a model for stock and refine stock logic, decreasing stock for every successful checkout.

- Images should be added for the README.md displaying the look of certain pages as described in the user stories and implementation.

## Testing

### Test Strategy
#### **Summary**
Testing is to be made to ensure all features of the website is working as intended and that the links lead to the appropriate pages. Tests must be made to judge the websites responsiveness. Additionally, that all inputs done through the forms will submit the data to the appropriate collections. It is also there to ensure the project's code structure abides the universal best practices for programming. 

HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri).

CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/).

Python Code must pass through [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)

### Test Results

Test Results are documented through [this link](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

### Project Creation

- Project started using Github and Gitpod.

1. First I signed into Github and created a new repository. There will be a drop down menu when looking to use a template
    so I chose to use Code Institute's Template. Alternatively, you can [navigate here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
    and there will be an option button called "Use this template".

2. I then clicked the use this template button. Where I was directed to create a new repository name and create a new 
    repository which I could open using Gitpod.

3. It creates a Gitpod workspace of which I could start developing the project.

### Local Deployment

To deploy the project locally, the following commands were used:

1. 

### Version Control 

In the terminal, I utilised the following commands in the following order:

- git add . (git add <em>filename</em>) - command to add all files or a specific file 
- git commit -m <em>commit message</em> - command to commit the changes locally with a message to describe the changes briefly
- git push - command to push changes to remote Github repository

### Deployment to Heroku
**Create application:**

1. I signed into Heroku 
2. I created a new app by clicking the "new" button.
3. Select the new app 
4. Create an app project name 
5. Selected Europe as the region

**Set up connection to Github Repository:**

1. A requirements.txt needs to be created, this can be done through the following terminal command
    >  pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. Then a Procfile for Heroku is needs to be created, here is the terminal command used
    >  echo web: python app.py > Procfile

3. Ensure there the Procfile begins with a capital letter 'P' and that there are no unecessary spaces 

4. Click the deploy tab and select Github - connect to Github

5. There will be an empty input field where you can type the name of your repository. Write the repo name there and 
    click search

6. Once the repository has been found, click the connect button

**Set environment variables:**

- 

<strong>Example:</strong>

- 

**Enable Automatic Deployment & Manual Deployment:**

- Ensure your Procfile and requirements.txt are in your repository as Heroku will not be able to deploy without these
- Click the Deploy tab
- Click Enable Automatic deploys in 'Automatic Deploys' section
- Choose the branch you would like to deploy and click "Deploy Branch"

### Local Clone

**Note: To run this project locally...**

This is used when you would like to make changes to the project code

1. Should you wish to use a different IDE like VSCode. You first log in to Github and locate the required repository. Here is the link for this [repository](https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/SneakrHead)
2. Open a new terminal on Git Bash
3. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/SneakrHead
```

 Here is a link that can explain this process further. [Click Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)

### Fork Project 

You can fork the repository through the following steps. Forking the repository means you will have a copy of the repository and any changes you make will not affect the original repository.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository. Here is a link for the [repository](https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/SneakrHead)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu. Looking towards the right of the page. Locate the button "Fork" then click 
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

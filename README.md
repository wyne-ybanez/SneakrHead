### **The Strategy Plane**

The main target audience of the website are online shoppers particularly those who are into sports brands, trainers and sneakers. 
The site will implement a header image of a popular sports brand's trainers and this will communicate what the site is about, an e-commerce store for sneakers. The website allows like minded sneaker fans to search, purchase and create an account. 

The store will utilise and effective navigation and search functionality so as to assist potential buyers with viewing and browsing. This strategy will also allow established users to easily view products they may want to purchase. The site will also utilise a shopping basket functionality.

#### Database Security

The website takes advantage of Django's security features to protect all data that is inputted and stored within the site. It does so through the features of a superuser, who can manipulate data through the administrator's page. 

It utilises CSRF protection so as to ensure that forms are validated and secure. It checks for a secret within each POST request. Thus, ensures that a malicious actor can't POST to the site and have another logged in user unwittingly submit that form.

The site also uses Host header validation: Django validates Host headers against the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in the django.http.HttpRequest.get_host() method. (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/security/)

Additionally, the site exploits Amazon's AWS S3 which provides server-side encryption (SSE) for uploaded static images within the site.

Database security is also maintained through the workspace environment through the following command `export VARIABLE = VARIABLE VALUE` or by going to gitpod and changing the environment variables manually. During development, these variables are then accessed through the local environment which ensures that the configuration files are not stored in github. For production, the configuration details are placed into the app settings and Heroku variables instead.

### **The Surface Plane**
### Design

#### Colour Scheme

#212529 - Bootstrap Dark

#F8F9FA - Bootstrap Light

#0DCAF0 - Bootstrap Info 

#FF6347 - Tomato

#20C997 - Light Green

#### Typography

The main typography used for the website is 'Caveat' for the home/landing page. 'Prompt' for headings and 'Roboto' for other minor texts. These all derive from Google Fonts. 

## Features

### Existing Features

- Home page/Landing Page which contains a hero image, the New Arrivals with product cards and an action button to quickly go shopping
- Registration feature which allows users to sign up and create an account
- Log in Feature which allows users to sign into their account
- Search functionality which is on the navbar on medium to large screens. This is also available to smaller devices in the products.html page

- Horizontal Product display feature which shows the designated featured products as chosen by the site owner.
- Website and Data security with every form submission.
- A shopping basket feature which stores the shopper's desired products and respective quantities prior to completing the checkout process. 
- Checkout level which assists user's with payments and keeping their billing information secure.

### Future Implementations & Room for Improvement

- The Categories/Products grid was initially utilised to assist customers/users with accessing certain products through an image grid. For this purpose of this project, the grid was focused primarily on front-end and did not contain any backend. Hence, it has been removed for assessment and will be refined and re-added.

- In future I would like to allow customers to contact the store owners through a contact form. 

- I would like to add more content such as products and images in the AWS S3 bucket for the use of this project.

- The basket page does not look appealing on mobiles phones or on small devices. In future, I would like to refactor the code on this page so as to improve the look and style of the mobile display for the page.

- In future I would like to fine tune this project even further and ensure that it passes Pep8/Flake 8, W3C HTML, CSS and JS Hint validators. At the moment the project still has many errors regarding best practices and validation.

- Refine the sizing logic and parameters for certain products such as socks or shoes e.g size UK 9.5. 

- Have a model for stock and refine stock logic, decreasing stock for every successful checkout.

- Images should be added for the README.md displaying the look of certain pages as described in the user stories and implementation.

## Testing

### Test Strategy
#### **Summary**
Testing is to be made to ensure all features of the website is working as intended and that the links lead to the appropriate pages. Tests must be made to judge the websites responsiveness. Additionally, that all inputs done through the forms must submit the data to the appropriate collections. It is also there to ensure the project's code structure abides the universal best practices for programming. The following validators are planned to be used.

HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri).

CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/).

Python Code must pass through [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)

### Test Results

Test Results are documented through [this link](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

### Project Creation

- Project started using Github and Gitpod.

1. First I signed into Github and created a new repository. There will be a drop down menu when looking to use a template
    so I chose to use Code Institute's Template. Alternatively, you can [navigate here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
    and there will be an option button called "Use this template".

2. I then clicked the use this template button. Where I was directed to create a new repository name and create a new 
    repository which I could open using Gitpod.

3. It creates a Gitpod workspace of which I could start developing the project.

### Local Deployment

To deploy the project locally, the following commands were used:

1. 

### Version Control 

In the terminal, I utilised the following commands in the following order:

- git add . (git add <em>filename</em>) - command to add all files or a specific file 
- git commit -m <em>commit message</em> - command to commit the changes locally with a message to describe the changes briefly
- git push - command to push changes to remote Github repository

### Deployment to Heroku
**Create application:**

1. I signed into Heroku 
2. I created a new app by clicking the "new" button.
3. Select the new app 
4. Create an app project name 
5. Selected Europe as the region

**Set up connection to Github Repository:**

1. A requirements.txt needs to be created, this can be done through the following terminal command
    >  pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. Then a Procfile for Heroku is needs to be created, here is the terminal command used
    >  echo web: python app.py > Procfile

3. Ensure there the Procfile begins with a capital letter 'P' and that there are no unecessary spaces 

4. Click the deploy tab and select Github - connect to Github

5. There will be an empty input field where you can type the name of your repository. Write the repo name there and 
    click search

6. Once the repository has been found, click the connect button

**Set environment variables:**

- 

<strong>Example:</strong>

- 

**Enable Automatic Deployment & Manual Deployment:**

- Ensure your Procfile and requirements.txt are in your repository as Heroku will not be able to deploy without these
- Click the Deploy tab
- Click Enable Automatic deploys in 'Automatic Deploys' section
- Choose the branch you would like to deploy and click "Deploy Branch"

### Local Clone

**Note: To run this project locally...**

This is used when you would like to make changes to the project code
